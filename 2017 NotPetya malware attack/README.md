## **2017 NotPetya malware attack**

Two years after the Ukraine power grid attack, Sandworm struck again, this time with a malware attack that, while almost certainly focused on Ukraine, inflicted enormous collateral damage across the globe.Itâ€™s estimated that organisations collectively lost $1 billion as a result of the attack.

NotPetya was so named because it initially resembled a ransomware attack called Petya, which was named after a weapons system in the James Bond film GoldenEye. But NotPetya proved to be a more significant and virulent threat. Like the WannaCry ransomware that also caused global havoc in 2017, it utilised a Windows Server Message Block (SMB) exploit to spread more rapidly.

Interestingly, although NotPetya gave the impression of being a ransomware attack, clues quickly began to suggest that the motives of its creators were more political than financial and that Ukraine was their main target. One such clue was the software used to initiate the infection was the Ukrainian tax software, M.E.Doc, which is used throughout the country. As a result, 80% of NotPetya infections were estimated to have occurred in Ukraine.
